This paper describes a proposed method for the extraction of medical history by clinical sentence classication. Because of the limited number of words used in clinical sentences, this problem is considered that of short text classication. To mitigate the error in short text classication, we propose an unsupervised topic modeling-based smoothing method that uses an internal knowledge acquisition mechanism without employing any external dictionary. We employ this method to enrich the representation of the sentences in a data set of clinical cardiovascular notes from the Cardiology department at the UMC Utrecht.
