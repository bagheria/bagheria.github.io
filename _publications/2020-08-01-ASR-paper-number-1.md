Conducting a systematic review requires great screening effort. Various tools have been proposed to speed up the process of screening thousands of titles and abstracts by engaging in active learning. In active learning, the reviewer interacts with machine learning software to identify relevant publications as early as possible. To gain a comprehensive understanding of active learning models for reducing workload in systematic reviews, the current study provides an methodical overview of such models. Active learning models were evaluated across four different classification techniques (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) and two different feature extraction strategies (TF-IDF and Doc2vec). Moreover, models were evaluated across six systematic review datasets from various research areas to assess generalizability of active learning models across different research contexts.
