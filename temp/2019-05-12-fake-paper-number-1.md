Fake opinion attacks, consisting of the malicious dissemination of fake reviews, can be detrimental to both customers as well as organizations. Several methods have been proposed to automatically detect deceptive reviews; however, these rely on manual feature engineering methods to build classifiers based on labeled data. Deep Neural Networks coupled with an Attention mechanism have recently been shown to improve the performance of many classification tasks, as it enables the model to learn and focus automatically on the most the important features. This paper describes our approach to apply an attention based deep neural network for the detection of truthful versus fake reviews.
