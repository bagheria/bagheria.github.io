The SALTClass package is a machine learning-based NLP toolkit. It contains several functions for text preprocessing, cleaning, clustering, and classification. The SALTClass package proposes smoothing methods based on seven clustering algorithms, namely, LDA, K-Means, MiniBatchK-Means, BIRCH, Mean-Shift, DBScan, and GMM. Smoothing methods are applied to the resulting cluster information to enrich the representation of sparse text. For the subsequent prediction step, ten different supervised classifiers have also been integrated into SALTClass. The SALTClass software package enables users to apply various configuration combinations to their case study. To evaluate the effectiveness of SALTClass, we analyze the cardiovascular notes collected in the UMC Utrecht.
