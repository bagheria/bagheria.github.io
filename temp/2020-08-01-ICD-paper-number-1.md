This paper aims to create a high performing deep learning pipeline for the automated multi-label classification of reliable ICD-10 codes in the clinical free text in the cardiology domain. In this paper, we focus on the frequently used and well defined three-digit ICD-10 codes. We investigate the usage of solely the summary paragraph of discharge letters (conclusion), adding clinical variables (age / sex) and multi-label classification as is the case in clinical practice.
