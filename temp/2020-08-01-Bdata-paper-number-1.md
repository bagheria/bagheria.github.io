This paper studies the current opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of electrophysiology with a focus on deep learning using 12-lead ECGs. In this narrative review, challenges in implementation, external validity, subgroup differences, interpretability, uncertainty and legal and ethical aspect are described. While AI and big data create many exciting opportunities in electrophysiology, a clinician should be able to recognize the threats and flaws of AI when interpreting literature or implementing algorithms in clinical practice.
