A crucial task in sentiment analysis is aspect detection: the step of selecting the aspects on which opinions are expressed. This step anticipates the step of determining whether the opinions on aspects are positive or negative. This article proposes a novel probabilistic generative topic model for aspect-based sentiment analysis which is able to discover the latent structure of a large collection of review documents.
