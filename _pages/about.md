I am an Assistant Professor in the area of [Applied Data Science](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/) at the Methodology and Statistics department of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). 

The main focus of my academic career has been to develop Intelligent Systems for improving health, medical care, and social science by mining big data, especially text data. My current interests include Text Analysis, Applied Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Machine Learning. For a more detailed view of my research, you may want to take a look at my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=QWhiQdgAAAAJ&hl=en).

As part of the [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) team, I also work on projects related to automated systematic text reviewing by using deep learning and active learning
