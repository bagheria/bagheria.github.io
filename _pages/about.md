Ayoub Bagheri leads the Natural Language and Text Processing ([NLTP](https://nlp.sites.uu.nl/)) group in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University and has strong links with the Human Data Science lab ([HDS](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/)). His main interests include fundamental research in text mining and natural language processing, with particular emphasis on areas such as bias detection, explainable AI, large language models, and practical applications of language models in computational social sciences and health research.

For a more detailed view of his research, you may want to take a look at my [Utrecht University webpage](https://www.uu.nl/staff/ABagheri) and / or [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=QWhiQdgAAAAJ&hl=en).

* As part of the [NLTP](https://nlp.sites.uu.nl/) group, he works on projects in NLP method development, text mining, explainable AI, and personality detection.
* As part of the [HDS](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/) lab, he works on projects in the domain of applied data science for health and social sciences.
* As part of the [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) team, he works on projects related to AI-assisted systematic reviewing by using deep learning, active learning, and text mining approaches.
