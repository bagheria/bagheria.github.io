I am an Assistant Professor in the area of [Applied Data Science](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/) at the Methodology and Statistics department of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). 

The main focus of my academic career has been to develop open source Intelligent Systems for improving health, education, and social sciences by mining big data, especially text data. My current interests include Text Analysis, Applied Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Machine Learning. For a more detailed view of my research, you may want to take a look at my [Utrecht University webpage](https://www.uu.nl/staff/ABagheri) and / or [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=QWhiQdgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Team Science:

- As part of the [Human Data Science](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/) group, I work on several projects in the domain of applied data science for health and social sciences.

- As part of the [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) team, I also work on projects related to automated systematic text reviewing by using deep learning and active learning.
