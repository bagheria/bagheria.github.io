### About me

Since December 2017, I am a researcher at the Department of Methodology and Statistics in the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). I also affiliated with the Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, [University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU)](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/1).

Between 2013 and 2017 I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Kashan](https://www.kashanu.ac.ir/en) in the Computer Engineering group. In 2017, I have been received the best teaching award at the University of Kashan.

I received my PhD in 2013 from the [Isfahan University of Technology](https://www.iut.ac.ir/en), where I worked in the [Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.iut.ac.ir/en) - Artificial Intelligence group. In 2012, I was a visiting researcher at the [Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/) in the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/). [Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/) was my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science. 

In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of data mining, machine learning & information retrieval, including aspect-based sentiment analysis (the topic of my PhD thesis), medical data and text mining, recommender systems, review spam detection, and social network analysis.

My main research interests are Machine Learning and Text Mining and am always happy to dive into related applications. Currently, together with M&S researchers and scientists from the UMCU, I am focusing on Big Data Analysis for Cardiovascular Diseases and how to incorporate clinical text data and clinical trial data into the learning process at population data.
