## About me

Since December 2017, I am a researcher at the Department of Methodology and Statistics in the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en).
I also affiliated with the Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, [University Medical Center Utrecht](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/1).
Between 2013 and 2017 I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Kashan] (https://kashanu.ac.ir/en) in the Computer Engineering group.
I received my PhD in 2013 from the [Isfahan University of Technology](https://www.iut.ac.ir/en), where I worked in the [Computer Engineering Department]
(https://ece.iut.ac.ir/en) - Artificial Intelligence group. In 2012, I was a visiting researcher at the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/) in the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/). 
[Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/) was my home during my undergraduate years as a student
in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of data mining, machine learning & information retrieval, 
including aspect-based sentiment analysis (the topic of my PhD thesis), medical data and text mining, recommender systems, review spam detection, and social network analysis.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with M&S researcher and scientists from UMC Utrecht, I am currently focusing on Big Data Analysis for Cardiovascular Diseases and how to incorporate clinical text data and clinical trial data into the learning process at population data. In 2017, I have been received the best teaching award at the University of Kashan.
